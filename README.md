## Bakery Game
### Introduction
This game is a project for **Code Your Chances**, and organization that focuses on introducing young girls to creative applications of code. For more information, you can check out their website linked [here](https://www.codeyourchances.com).

Our game is a single player cooking simulation VR game (what a mouthful) where the player must run a bakery as the head chef. Tickets flood in and customers get angry on the quest to create a masterpiece of a pastry!

### Our Team and Contributions
We are currently a group of Vanderbilt students part of the organization **Change++** (linked [here](https://www.changeplusplus.org)). We aren't looking for contributions at the moment, but we may in the future!

### Important Notes (for developers)
- The most important scene for testing is Assets/TestScenes/BakeryTestScenes
